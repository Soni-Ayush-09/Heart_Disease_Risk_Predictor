# Heart_Disease_Risk_Predictor

#Background:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to pose a significant global health threat, claiming millions of lives annually. Early detection and preventive measures are crucial for reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes R, a widely used statistical programming language, to develop a machine learning-based model for predicting heart disease risk.

1.Data Acquisition:
Publicly available datasets, such as the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, will be utilized. These datasets contain various features relevant to cardiovascular health, including demographics, medical history, lifestyle habits, and clinical measurements.

2.Data Preprocessing: 
R packages like dplyr and caret will be employed to clean, pre-process, and transform the data, ensuring its suitability for machine learning algorithms. Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques will be applied to understand the data distribution and identify potential biases.

3.Model Development:
R's powerful machine learning packages like glmnet, caret, and mlr3 will be used to implement and evaluate various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance.

4.Deployment and User Interface:
Shiny, a web framework within R, will be used to develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and individuals to access and utilize the risk prediction model.

5.Expected Outcomes:
  1.A robust and accurate R-based model for predicting the risk of heart disease.
  2.Improved early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases through personalized risk assessment using R.
  3.Enhanced decision-making for healthcare professionals in managing patients with heart disease risk factors.
  4.Increased public awareness and knowledge about heart disease prevention strategies.


6.Significance:
This project leverages the powerful R programming language to develop a valuable tool for predicting heart disease risk. Such a tool can contribute significantly to improving public health outcomes and reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases globally.
